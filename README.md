# BilleterApp

Expense tracker project made entirely with python. Designed to be robust but easy to use as a desktop App with a basic UI made with PyQt5. On one machine, several users can be created which can have several accounts with all their expenses/incomes/transfers. All existing currencies can be used when creating accounts.

This app was created with the idea of tracking the expenses in the most similar way that they occur in real life. Any income/expense can be added with their specific date and time, no matter when it is being tracked. The only detail to bare in mind is that no negative values are allowed for totals.

As of today, there are some trivial features that are not implemented yet, like: deletion of operations, deletion of accounts, among others. But they will be implemented soon.

There are other features that would be awsome to implement, like:
- Deferred expenses, like the ones with credit cards - so the user can have a detail of the amount of money is going to have to pay in the future, for example
- Flow of money vs real incomes and real expenses: it is not the same to pay the check of a restaurant for you and 3 friends, if they are going to pay you their part, than only paying for you. The first case was money that flown out from you and the second case is a real expense. 
- Insightfull graphs and dashboards for understanding the way money is being spent.

etc.
